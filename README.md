# Chained Adversarial Reasoning
## CSCI 2470 Final Project
The framework for our initial 5-stage reasoning pipeline can be found in /5-stage-reasoning/. Our scaled back 1-stage reasoning, which is what we ended up running, can be found in /1-stage/reasoning. Our training and eval dataset can be found in /data/, and our model evals can be found in /evals/.
