## 1 Stage Reasoning
In order to run 1 stage reasoning, download and open csci2470_1stageFinal.ipynb in Google Colab, import sandbox.py and rl_loop.py, and run. This requires ~48GB VRAM, so an alternative is to load these models across
seperate Google Colab instances. To do this, you can run the generator.ipynb and discriminator.ipynb files in seperate Colab sessions, and the sandbox.ipynb in a third instance (with only CPU).
Then, copy paste the outputs of the generator and discriminator to the sandbox, and paste back the calculated rewards.
